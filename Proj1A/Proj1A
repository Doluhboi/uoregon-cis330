Before I got to college I had zero programming experience. Actually it wasn't
until my sophomore year, when I took CIS 110 as a gen ed that I decided that
I really enjoyed the subject. When it comes to C, the only experience I have 
is seeing examples and coding a few simple assignments in 313 an314 last term.
The syntaz is fairly similar to Java so it was not as hard as I thought it
would be to understand it initially. I'm still not completely comfortable with 
the lauguage yet. 
I'm excited about this class because I am not confident using the terminal 
and these assignments will give me the opportunity to practice that. I work 
in a computer hardware repair shop and we often need to use the terminal to
perform the checks that we are doing. At this point I am blindly copying 
commands into the command line and not really understanding how it all works.
I look forward to building a better understanding of the operations and 
processes behind the commands. 
I don't have anything else to say so I'm going to practice copy and paste.
