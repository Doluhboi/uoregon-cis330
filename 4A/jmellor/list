	The problems were: Line 16, char* needs to be char
			Object::Object needs data = (char*) malloc(x*sizeof(char));
			Line 32, char* needs to be char
			Line 40, shouldn't free b, it is in the stack

	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [X] YES    [ ] NO

	The problems were: Likely not intended, but I needed to include stdlib.h
			All char* in Bad_mem need to be initialized to some size
			Line 58, need to make new Bad_mem, not just declare
			Line 78-79, should not free at all since the data was not malloc'ed and is used again later, should use stats-> not stats. if free was valid

	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [X] NO


kpinto
	The problems were: ResetCount should either allocate space for the int * var or just set x=0
			The for loop in main is infinite due to setting i = -1 in the loop. May not be a bug, but I didn't find any others.
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [X] NO


sgd
	The problems were: Program incomplete...
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [X] NO


dbeick
	The problems were: Line 13-14, should allocate sizeOf(int)*(w*h*d) and sizeOf(int*)*(w*h*d), not just (w*h*d)
			Line 18, should use j < h not i < h
			Line 30, should not free buffer yet since buffer2, which only contains the addresses of the data in buffer, is used after this point
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [X] YES    [ ] NO


colter
	The problems were: Again needed to include stdlib.h
			foo(), needs malloc for char* x to allow assignment
			foo2(), x is set to unallocated space
			foo3(), needs malloc for char* x to allow assignment
			Line 45, Should not use object after delete
			Line 47, need (char*) malloc(3)
			Line 56, pointer used again after being set
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [X] NO
