	The problems were:
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [ ] NO

	The problems were:
		NULL pointer assignment: char *secondword = firstword;
		char *arraysize[2] = {NULL, NULL};
		the for loop is for i=0 to 6 but input only has arraysize 2 and they are trying to access too many indices, the error continues into the assignment of input[i] 		
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [x] NO

	The problems were: 
		printing out x3 when x = NULL in line 23
		deleting x when it wasn't allocated in line 36
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [x] YES    [ ] NO
		Author thinks there is 1? there were actually two
		appropriate for this project, but not as instructive as some

abdul
	The problems were: 
		not freeing any memory after allocating it, buf1 and buf2
		did the author count each memory leak as an error? 
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [x] NO


johnsto3
	The problems were:
		line 28 t[0] = f; assignment to unallocated array

	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [x] NO
		no name for author or number of memory errors

jkrakows
	The problems were:
		deleting power and x and then using it again - line 28/29
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [x] YES    [ ] NO
		didn't say how many errors, but most appropriate bad_prog.C i've seen
