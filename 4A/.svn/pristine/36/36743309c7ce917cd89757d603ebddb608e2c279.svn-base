	The problems were: assinging a pixel value to a temporary variable and when the program frees the data it only frees the tmp variable not the acctual memory allocated there.
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [ ] NO

	The problems were: 1) tried to free memory (arr) that wasnt on the heap
                           2) after the deletion of arr2 the programmer tries to set values                              in arr2
                           3) the programmer assigns arr2[4] to a variable a1 that isn't
                              ever deleted
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [ ] NO

	The problems were: 1) trying to print out a NUll value
                           2) deletes value before trying to print it out
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [ ] NO

	The problems were: 1) in the first for loop section, the programmer is tyring to
                             assign values to the buffer that are outside the scope of that                             buffer.
                           2) in the second for loop, the programmer is trying to pass in
                              addresses instead of actual int values
                           3) in the third for loop the programmer is trying to print out                                int values but it doesnt have any values in it because it 
                              couldn't pass in the correct values to the buffer2
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [X] YES    [ ] NO


sgd
	The problems were: This is an incomplete program, nothing works
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [ ] NO


magana
	The problems were: 1) tried to free strptr twice
                           2) tried to copy a string over to strptr after it was freed
	This was one of the most instructive programs I debugged: [ ] YES    [ ] NO
